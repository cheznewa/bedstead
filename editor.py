    # The output from 'bedstead' will be a set of disjoint paths,
    # in the Postscript style (going one way around the outside of
    # filled areas, and the other way around internal holes in
    # those areas). Python/Tk doesn't know how to fill an
    # arbitrary path in that representation, so instead we must
    # convert into a set of individual Tk polygons (convex shapes
    # with a single closed outline) and display them in the right
    # order with the right colour.
    #
    # A neat way to arrange this is to compute the area enclosed
    # by each polygon, essentially by integration: for each line
    # segment (x0,y0)-(x1,y1), sum the y difference (y1-y0) times
    # the average x value, which gives the area between that line
    # segment and the corresponding segment of the x-axis. After
    # we go all the way round an outline in this way, we'll have
    # precisely the area enclosed by the outline, no matter how
    # many times it doubles back on itself (because every piece of
    # x-axis has been cancelled out by an outline going back the
    # other way). Furthermore, the sign of the integral we've
    # computed tells us whether the outline goes one way or the
    # other around the area.
    #
    # So then we sort our paths into descending order of the
    # absolute value of its computed area (guaranteeing that any
    # path contained inside another appears after it, since it
    # must enclose a strictly smaller area) and fill each one with
    # a colour based on the area's sign.
    #
    # This strategy depends critically on 'bedstead' having given
    # us sensible paths in the first place: it wouldn't handle an
    # _arbitrary_ PostScript path, with loops allowed to overlap
    # and intersect rather than being neatly nested.
