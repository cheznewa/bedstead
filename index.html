    <h1>Bedstead &ndash; MODE 7 for the 21st century</h1>
    <p>Bedstead is an outline font based on the characters produced by the
      Mullard SAA5050 series of Teletext Character Generators.  The
      SAA5050 is familiar to those of a certain age as the one that
      produced the <code>MODE 7</code> display on the BBC
      Microcomputer.  It generates characters from a 5 × 9 pixel
      matrix, smoothing diagonal lines to produce an interlaced 10 ×
      18 matrix for each character.  This font it generated by an
      extension of the SAA5050’s smoothing algorithm.  In addition to
      the characters available from the SAA5050 itself, the font
      includes characters from the other chips in the family
      (including Cyrillic and Hebrew alphabets), an Arabic alphabet
      found in an EBU document, and various other useful glyphs.  All
      glyphs are drawn on the same 5 × 9 pixel grid, albeit with a
      slight variation to let the Arabic characters join up.</p>

    <p>The outline version of the font is generated by an ANSI C program
      which emits a Spline Font Database file for use with
      <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">Fontforge</a>, which
      can convert it into most reasonable font formats.</p>
